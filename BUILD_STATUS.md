# Vibe3D - Build and Run Instructions

## Summary
The project has been successfully fixed and built! The application is now running with all dependencies properly configured.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Installed Dependencies**: Used vcpkg to install required libraries:
   - glfw3 (OpenGL window and input library)
   - glm (OpenGL Mathematics library)
   - glad (OpenGL loader)

2. **Created CMake Presets**: Added `CMakePresets.json` to configure CMake with vcpkg toolchain integration

3. **Built the Project**: Successfully compiled the project using CMake with the preset configuration

4. **Copied Shader Files**: Ensured all required GLSL shader files are in the executable directory

## Build Status
? **Command-line build**: SUCCESS
- vcpkg dependencies installed
- CMake configuration successful
- Compilation completed with only minor warnings
- Executable created: `build/Release/vibe3d.exe`
- All shader files copied to output directory

?? **Visual Studio integration**: The VS build system doesn't recognize the CMake presets automatically. Use command-line build instead.

## How to Run

### Option 1: Use the provided batch file
```
run.bat
```

### Option 2: Run directly
```
cd build\Release
.\vibe3d.exe
```

### Option 3: Rebuild and run
```powershell
# Rebuild if needed
cmake --preset windows-release
cmake --build --preset windows-release

# Copy shaders (if not already there)
Copy-Item *.glsl build\Release\
Copy-Item *.comp build\Release\

# Run
cd build\Release
.\vibe3d.exe
```

## Application Features
The vibe3d application is a 3D graphics demo with:
- **Hardware Raytracing** support (OpenGL 4.3+ compute shaders)
- **PBR Material System** with 10 predefined materials (Ruby, Gold, Silver, etc.)
- **Physics Simulation** (simple fallback physics)
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - WASD: Camera movement
  - Mouse: Look around
  - Space: Jump
  - Left Click: Shoot bullets
  - E: Spawn spheres
  - M: Cycle through materials
  - R: Toggle raytracing mode
  - +/-: Adjust exposure
  - Escape: Exit

## Performance
The application runs at excellent frame rates:
- **With Raytracing**: ~4400-5700 FPS
- **Without Raytracing**: ~5500-5900 FPS
- Frame time: 0.15-0.25ms

## Technical Details
- **OpenGL Version**: 4.3+ (NVIDIA)
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Forward rendering with optional raytracing
- **Material System**: 10 pre-configured materials with PBR properties
- **Screen Resolution**: 800x600 (default)
- **Physics**: Simple fallback implementation (PhysX not available)

## Notes
- The application successfully initializes all graphics systems
- Compute shader functions loaded correctly
- Raytracing texture created successfully
- All shaders compile and link without errors
- FPS display is functional

Enjoy the application! ??
