## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture for Monetization

### Licensing System Design

```cpp
// License key structure (example)
struct License {
    std::string email;
    std::string key;           // SHA256(email + secret + tier)
    LicenseTier tier;          // Free, Pro, Studio, Enterprise
    time_t expiration;         // Subscription end date
    bool isValid;              // Online validation
};

// Validation flow:
1. User enters license key
2. App validates format locally (instant feedback)
3. App contacts license server (activation + validation)
4. Store encrypted license in user directory
5. Periodic validation (every 7 days)
6. Graceful degradation if offline (30-day grace period)
```

### Feature Gating System

```cpp
// Feature availability by tier
enum class Feature {
    RealTimePreview,      // All tiers
    ExportWatermarked,    // Free+
    Export4K,             // Pro+
    Export8K,             // Studio+
    BatchRendering,       // Pro+
    APIAccess,            // Studio+
    CustomBranding,       // Studio+
    CommercialLicense     // Studio+
};

// Usage:
if (licenseManager.hasFeature(Feature::Export4K)) {
    exportImage(4096, 4096);
} else {
    showUpgradeDialog("4K Export requires Pro license");
}
```

### Telemetry & Analytics (Privacy-Focused)

```cpp
// Anonymous usage statistics
struct TelemetryEvent {
    std::string event_type;   // "render", "export", "preset_load"
    std::string version;      // "1.0.0"
    time_t timestamp;
    
    // NO personal data collected
    // NO tracking of specific models/materials
};

// Use cases:
- Feature usage patterns (what to prioritize)
- Crash reporting (improve stability)
- Performance metrics (optimize bottlenecks)
```

```cpp
// Add to ForwardPlusRenderer.h
void exportScreenshot(const std::string& filename, 
                      uint32_t width, 
                      uint32_t height,
                      bool addWatermark = false);

// Use case:
renderer->exportScreenshot("output.png", 3840, 2160, 
                          licenseManager.isFree());
```

### Week 2: Watermark System

```cpp
// Watermark rendering (for free tier)
void renderWatermark(VkCommandBuffer cmd) {
    if (licenseManager.isFree()) {
        // Render "Vibe3D Community Edition" text overlay
        imguiManager_->renderText("Created with Vibe3D Community Edition",
                                  position, opacity);
    }
}
```

### Week 3: Preset Marketplace Foundation

```json
// Material preset format
{
  "name": "Brushed Aluminum",
  "author": "username",
  "version": "1.0",
  "price": 2.99,
  "material": {
    "albedo": [0.8, 0.8, 0.8],
    "roughness": 0.3,
    "metallic": 1.0,
